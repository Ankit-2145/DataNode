# Introduction to C language

## What is C?

C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development due to its efficiency and control over system resources.

## Key Features of C

C has several important features that make it widely used in system programming and embedded systems:

1. **Portability**: C programs are machine-independent, meaning they can run on different hardware platforms.
2. **Low-level access**: C allows manipulation of hardware resources like memory, which is useful in systems programming.
3. **Modularity**: C programs can be divided into modules or functions, making code reusable.
4. **Speed**: C is a compiled language and is faster than many interpreted languages like Python.

## Why Learn C?

The C programming language is foundational in the world of software development. Many modern languages are built on the principles established by C, making it an essential language for programmers to learn. Here are some reasons why C remains relevant:

- **Efficiency**: C provides low-level access to memory and hardware, making it ideal for writing fast and optimized programs.
- **Portability**: C is highly portable, meaning a program written in C can be run on various types of machines with little to no modification.
- **System-Level Programming**: C is widely used for developing operating systems, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications.
- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Languages such as C++, C#, and even Python have syntactical roots in C, making it easier to transition to other languages once you know C.

## Structure of a C Program

A C program typically follows a structured format:

1. **Preprocessor directives**: These lines start with `#` and are used to include libraries.
2. **Main function**: Every C program must have a `main()` function.
3. **Variable declarations**: Declare variables at the start.
4. **Statements and expressions**: Instructions that define the logic of the program.
5. **Return statement**: The main function usually returns a value using the `return` keyword.

### Example of a Simple C Program

```c copy
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive

int main() {        // Main function
    int num = 10;   // Variable declaration
    printf("Hello, World! Number: %d", num);  // Output statement
    return 0;       // Return statement
}
```
