# C Programming

C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.

## C Language Introduction

The main features of the C language include:

- **General Purpose and Portable**
- **Low-level Memory Access**
- **Fast Speed**
- **Clean Syntax**

These features make the C language suitable for system programming like operating systems or compiler development.

## Why Should We Learn C?

Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language, including Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many others. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

If you learn C programming first, it will help you learn any modern programming language as well. Additionally, learning C helps to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of operating systems, such as pointers and memory locations.

## Difference Between C and C++

C++ was created to add the OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) concept to the C language, so they both have very similar syntax with a few differences. The main differences between C and C++ include:

- C++ supports the OOPs paradigm while C only has the procedural concept of programming.
- C++ has exception handling capabilities, whereas C requires manual exception resolution.
- There are no references in C.

For a more detailed comparison, see [Difference between C and C++](#).

## Beginning with C Programming

### Writing the First Program in C

The following code is one of the simplest C programs that will help us understand the basic syntax structure of a C program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a = 10;
  printf("%d", a);

  return 0;
}
```
