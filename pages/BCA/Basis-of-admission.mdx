## Basis of Admission

The admission will purely be on the basis of the percentage of marks (rounded up to two decimal places) obtained in 10+2. If there is a tie, then:

1. The percentage of marks (rounded up to two decimal places) obtained in matriculation will be considered first.
2. If the tie persists, the candidates older in age will be given preference.
