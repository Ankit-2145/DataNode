### (i) Why is C called a structured language?

C is called a structured language because it promotes a systematic approach to program design through the use of functions, loops, and conditionals. This organization allows developers to break down complex problems into manageable modules, facilitating code reusability and maintainability. Furthermore, structured programming minimizes the use of goto statements, which helps in creating clearer control flow, enhancing program readability.

### (ii) What are the different symbols of a flowchart?

1. **Oval (Terminator)**: Represents the Start and End points of a process.
2. **Rectangle (Process)**: Indicates a process, action, or instruction that needs to be performed.
3. **Diamond (Decision)**: Represents a decision point that branches the flow based on a condition (Yes/No).
4. **Parallelogram (Input/Output)**: Used for input or output operations, like reading data or displaying results.
5. **Arrow (Flow Line)**: Shows the direction of the flow of control between symbols.

Flowcharts are essential for visualizing algorithms and understanding the logical flow of a program.

### (iii) Differentiate between constant and variable.

- **Constant**: A constant is a fixed value that remains unchanged throughout the program. For instance, in C, a constant can be declared using the `const` keyword:
  ```c
  const int maxUsers = 100;
  ```
  This signifies that `maxUsers` cannot be modified after its declaration.

- **Variable**: A variable is a symbolic name for a storage location that can hold different values during the program execution. For example:
  ```c
  int count = 0;
  ```
  Here, `count` can be modified as needed throughout the program.

In summary, constants provide stability, while variables allow for flexibility in code.

### (iv) Explain what is an operand? What is its relationship with operators?

An **operand** is a quantity on which an operator performs an action in an expression. For instance, in the expression `a + b`, both `a` and `b` are operands, while the `+` is the operator indicating the addition operation.

Operands can be variables, constants, or more complex expressions, while operators define the type of operation (arithmetic, relational, logical, etc.) to be performed on those operands. For example:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (used for mathematical operations).
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>` (used for comparisons).

Thus, operands and operators work together to form expressions that produce results.

### (v) Is it possible to declare and initialize an array in C simultaneously? If yes, how?

Yes, it is possible to declare and initialize an array in C simultaneously. This can be achieved using the following syntax:

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

In this example, an integer array named `arr` is declared with a size of 5 and initialized with the values 1 through 5. The size can be omitted during initialization, and the compiler will automatically determine it:

```c
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Compiler infers the size as 5
```

This simultaneous declaration and initialization are useful for setting up arrays with known values at the outset, ensuring efficient memory allocation.
