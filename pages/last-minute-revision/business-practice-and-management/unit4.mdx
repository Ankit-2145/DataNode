## 1. Authority and Responsibility

### Authority
- **Authority** is the right to make decisions, issue commands, and expect obedience.
- **Example**: A manager has the authority to assign tasks to employees.

### Responsibility
- **Responsibility** is the obligation to perform assigned duties.
- **Example**: Employees have the responsibility to complete tasks assigned by their manager.

### Relationship between Authority and Responsibility
- Authority and responsibility must go hand-in-hand for effective management. Delegating authority without responsibility leads to misuse, while assigning responsibility without authority makes task completion difficult.

# Communication: Nature, Process, and Types of Communication Networks

**Communication** is the process of sharing information and understanding between individuals or groups within an organization.

### Nature of Communication
- **Continuous Process**: Communication is ongoing and essential for coordination.
- **Two-Way**: It involves both sending and receiving information.
- **Foundation of Relationships**: Builds trust and understanding within the organization.

### Communication Process
1. **Sender**: Initiates the message.
2. **Encoding**: Converting the message into words, symbols, or gestures.
3. **Message**: The information being communicated.
4. **Channel**: The medium (e.g., email, meetings) through which the message is sent.
5. **Decoding**: Receiver interprets the message.
6. **Feedback**: Response from the receiver to the sender.

```

### Types of Communication Networks
1. **Chain Network**: Follows a linear pattern of communication, often hierarchical.
2. **Wheel Network**: All communication passes through a central figure.
3. **All-Channel Network**: Open communication where all members communicate freely.
4. **Circle Network**: Information flows in a closed-loop, often with limited reach.
