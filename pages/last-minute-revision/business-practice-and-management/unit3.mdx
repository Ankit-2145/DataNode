## 3. Motivation: Concepts and Theories

**Motivation** is the drive that encourages individuals to take action towards achieving goals.

   - People are motivated by needs arranged in a hierarchy, from basic (physiological) to self-fulfillment (self-actualization).
   - **Example**: Offering career advancement opportunities to meet employees' self-actualization needs.

   - Distinguishes between *motivators* (e.g., achievement, recognition) and *hygiene factors* (e.g., salary, working conditions).
   - **Example**: Providing a comfortable work environment (hygiene) and recognizing employees' efforts (motivator).

3. **McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y**
   - Theory X: Assumes people dislike work and need control.
   - Theory Y: Assumes people are self-motivated and seek responsibility.
   - **Example**: Adopting a Theory Y approach by giving employees autonomy.
