# VB.NET Overview

**VB.NET** (Visual Basic .NET) is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is built on the .NET framework and allows for building a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, and mobile apps.


## 1. Introduction to VB.NET

VB.NET is a **high-level programming language** that supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It is known for its ease of use and readability, making it suitable for beginners and advanced developers alike.

## 2. VB.NET Syntax Essentials

### Statements

- Statements in VB.NET are the building blocks of a program. They perform actions like declaring variables, calling methods, and controlling the flow of execution.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim num As Integer = 10
Console.WriteLine(num)
```

### Lines and Comments

- **Lines**: Each statement usually occupies one line in VB.NET. A statement can be split across multiple lines using an underscore (`_`).
- **Comments**: Used to explain code. Comments in VB.NET are preceded by an apostrophe (`'`).

**Example**:

```vb
' This is a single-line comment
Dim name As String = "VB.NET"
```

---

## 3. Operators in VB.NET

Operators in VB.NET allow for performing operations on variables and values. Common types include:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison Operators**: `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators**: `And`, `Or`, `Not`

**Example**:

```vb
Dim result As Integer = 5 + 3 ' result = 8
```

---

## 4. Procedures

In VB.NET, **procedures** are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. There are two main types:

- **Sub Procedures**: Perform actions without returning a value.
- **Function Procedures**: Perform actions and return a value.

**Example**:

```vb
Sub ShowMessage()
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, VB.NET!")
End Sub

Function AddNumbers(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
    Return a + b
End Function
```

---

## 5. Variables and Constants

### Variables

- Variables store data that can be modified during the execution of a program. Variables can be declared **implicitly** (without specifying the type) or **explicitly** (with a type).

**Implicit Declaration**:

```vb
Dim myVar = 10 ' VB.NET infers it as Integer
```

**Explicit Declaration**:

```vb
Dim myVar As Integer = 10
```

### Constants

- Constants store values that do not change during program execution.

**Example**:

```vb
Const Pi As Double = 3.14159
```

---

## 6. Arrays

An **array** in VB.NET is a collection of variables that share the same data type.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim numbers(5) As Integer ' Declares an array of 6 elements
numbers(0) = 10
```

---

## 7. Branching and Looping

### Branching

- **If-Else Statement**: Used to make decisions in the code.

**Example**:

```vb
If num > 10 Then
    Console.WriteLine("Greater than 10")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("Less than or equal to 10")
End If
```

### Looping

- **For Loop**, **While Loop**, and **Do-While Loop**: Used to repeat a block of code.

**Example**:

```vb
For i As Integer = 1 To 5
    Console.WriteLine(i)
Next
```

---

# Object-Oriented Programming in VB.NET

## 1. Objects and Classes

In VB.NET, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines properties, methods, and events that objects of that class will have.

**Example**:

```vb
Class Car
    Public Property Model As String
    Public Sub New(modelName As String)
        Model = modelName
    End Sub
End Class

Dim myCar As New Car("Toyota")
Console.WriteLine(myCar.Model)
```

---

## 2. Inheritance

**Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. In VB.NET, the keyword `Inherits` is used for this purpose.

**Example**:

```vb
Class Vehicle
    Public Sub Start()
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle started")
    End Sub
End Class

Class Car
    Inherits Vehicle
End Class

Dim myCar As New Car()
myCar.Start() ' Inherits Start() method from Vehicle
```

---

## 3. Accessibility of Inherited Properties and Methods

Inherited members (properties and methods) can have different levels of accessibility:

- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **Protected**: Accessible from the class itself and any derived classes.
- **Private**: Only accessible within the class.

---

## 4. Overriding Methods

**Overriding** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

**Example**:

```vb
Class Vehicle
    Public Overridable Sub Start()
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle started")
    End Sub
End Class

Class Car
    Inherits Vehicle
    Public Overrides Sub Start()
        Console.WriteLine("Car started")
    End Sub
End Class
```

---

# System Class

## 1. Working with Numbers

The **System.Math** class provides methods for performing mathematical operations like rounding, finding the square root, etc.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim result As Double = Math.Sqrt(16) ' result = 4
```

## 2. Manipulating Strings

The **System.String** class provides methods for string manipulation like concatenation, trimming, and searching.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim fullName As String = "John" & " " & "Doe"
```

## 3. DateTime Arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic operations on dates using the **DateTime** class.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim today As DateTime = DateTime.Now
Dim tomorrow As DateTime = today.AddDays(1)
```

## 4. Converting and Formatting Values

The **Convert** class is used to convert between different data types.

**Example**:

```vb
Dim str As String = "123"
Dim num As Integer = Convert.ToInt32(str)
```

---

# Namespace and Assemblies

## 1. Namespaces

A **namespace** is a way to organize code and avoid name conflicts. Namespaces group related classes, functions, and types together.

**Example**:

```vb
Namespace Vehicles
    Class Car
        ' Class definition
    End Class
End Namespace
```

## 2. Assemblies

An **assembly** is a compiled code library used by .NET applications. It can be an **EXE** or **DLL** file.

---

## 3. Relating Namespaces and DLL Assemblies

- **DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)** contain reusable code that can be shared between multiple applications. Each DLL contains one or more namespaces.

## 4. Creating and Importing Assemblies

### Creating Assemblies

- You can create assemblies by compiling a class library project in VB.NET.

### Importing Assemblies

- Assemblies can be imported into a VB.NET project using the `Imports` statement.

**Example**:

```vb
Imports System.Text
```

## 5. Using Imported Assemblies

Imported assemblies provide access to pre-built classes and functions.

---

## 6. Compiling with Imported Namespaces

When compiling a VB.NET project, the compiler uses the imported namespaces to resolve class and method references. This allows you to utilize functionality provided by external libraries and frameworks.
