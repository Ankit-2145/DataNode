# Introductory Concepts & C Fundamentals

## 1. Introductory Concepts

### Types of Programming Languages

- **Low-Level Languages**: These languages are closer to machine code and are hardware-specific. Examples include:
  - **Machine Language**: Consists of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that the computer understands directly.
  - **Assembly Language**: Uses mnemonics (like `ADD`, `MOV`) and needs an assembler to convert to machine code.

- **High-Level Languages**: These are closer to human language, making them easier to learn and use. Examples include C, Python, and Java.

### Introduction to C
- **C Language**: Created by **Dennis Ritchie** in 1972, C is a powerful general-purpose language used for system programming, developing operating systems, and other performance-critical applications. It provides low-level access to memory and is structured.

### Some Simple C Programs
- **Hello World Example**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- This program prints "Hello, World!" on the screen. The `#include` directive imports the standard input/output library, `main()` is the entry point, and `printf()` outputs the message.

### Desirable Program Characteristics
- **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand.
- **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable functions.
- **Efficiency**: Programs should minimize resource usage (CPU, memory).
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to update or modify.

## 2. C Fundamentals

### C Character Set
- **Letters**: A to Z, a to z.
- **Digits**: 0 to 9.
- **Special Characters**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `{`, `}`, etc.
- **Whitespace**: Spaces, tabs, and newlines are used to separate tokens.

### Identifiers and Keywords
- **Identifiers**: Names for variables, functions, etc. Must begin with a letter or an underscore.
  - Example: `int total;`, `float marks;`.
- **Keywords**: Reserved words in C (e.g., `int`, `return`, `if`) that cannot be used as variable names.

### Data Types
- **Basic Data Types**:
  - `int`: For integers (whole numbers), e.g., `int x = 5;`.
  - `float`: For floating-point numbers (decimals), e.g., `float y = 3.14;`.
  - `char`: For single characters, e.g., `char ch = 'A';`.
  - `double`: For large floating-point numbers.

- **Derived Data Types**: Arrays, pointers, structures.

### Constants, Variables, and Arrays
- **Constants**: Fixed values that do not change, defined using `#define` or the `const` keyword.
  - Example: `#define PI 3.14159`.
- **Variables**: Named storage locations in memory.
  - Example: `int age = 21;`.
- **Arrays**: A collection of variables of the same type stored sequentially in memory.
  - Example: `int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`.

### Declarations, Expressions, and Statements
- **Declarations**: Allocate memory for variables, e.g., `int a;`.
- **Expressions**: Combine variables and operators to produce a result, e.g., `a + b`.
- **Statements**: Instructions that perform an action, e.g., `a = 5;`.

### Symbolic Constants
- A symbolic name is given to a constant value using `#define`.
  - Example: `#define MAX 100`.
