# Objects and Classes in C++

## 1. Objects and Classes

### 1.1. A Simple Class
A class is a user-defined data type in C++ that can have both variables (data members) and functions (member functions).
```cpp
class Car {
  public:
    string brand;
    int year;

    void start() {
        cout << "Car started!" << endl;
    }
};
```

### 1.2. Classes and Objects
An **object** is an instance of a class. You can create objects of a class using the class name.
```cpp
Car myCar;
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2021;
myCar.start();
```

### 1.3. Specifying a Class
A class is defined using the `class` keyword. By default, all members are `private`. You can make them accessible using the `public` keyword.
```cpp
class Box {
  private:
    double length;
  public:
    void setLength(double len) {
        length = len;
    }

    double getLength() {
        return length;
    }
};
```

### 1.4. Using a Class
Once a class is defined, you can create objects and use its members.
```cpp
Box box1;
box1.setLength(10.0);
cout << "Length: " << box1.getLength();
```

### 1.5. C++ Objects as Physical Objects
Objects can represent physical entities in the real world. For example, a `Car` class could represent an actual car.
```cpp
class Car {
  public:
    string model;
    double speed;
    void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
    }
};
```

### 1.6. C++ Objects as Data Types
Objects can also represent more abstract data types. For example, an object of class `Vector` could represent a mathematical vector.

---

## 2. Constructors
Constructors are special functions that are automatically called when an object is created. They initialize the object's data members.
```cpp
class Box {
  public:
    double length;
    Box(double len) {
        length = len;
    }
};
```
**Example**:
```cpp
Box box1(10.0);
cout << "Length: " << box1.length;
```

---

## 3. Objects as Function Arguments
You can pass objects as arguments to functions.
```cpp
void printBox(Box box) {
    cout << "Box length: " << box.length << endl;
}
```

### 3.1. Returning Objects from Functions
A function can return an object.
```cpp
Box getBox(double len) {
    Box b(len);
    return b;
}
```

# Arrays in C++

## 1. Array Fundamentals
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
```cpp
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### 1.1. Defining an Array
An array is defined with a type, name, and size.
```cpp
int arr[10];
```

### 1.2. Accessing Array Elements
You can access array elements using the index.
```cpp
cout << arr[0];  // First element
```

### 1.3. Initializing Arrays
You can initialize arrays during declaration.
```cpp
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

### 1.4. Multidimensional Arrays
Arrays can have more than one dimension.
```cpp
int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
```

---

## 2. Passing Arrays to Functions
You can pass arrays as arguments to functions.
```cpp
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Array of Objects
You can also create an array of objects.
```cpp
class Student {
  public:
    string name;
    int age;
};

Student students[3] = {{"John", 20}, {"Anna", 22}, {"Mike", 21}};
```

---

## 4. Strings in C++

### 4.1. String Variables
Strings in C++ can be defined using character arrays or the `string` class.
```cpp
string name = "John";
```

### 4.2. Avoiding Buffer Overflow
Buffer overflow occurs when the program writes data beyond the bounds of a fixed-size buffer (e.g., a character array).
```cpp
char name[5];
strcpy(name, "Hello"); // Buffer overflow
```

### 4.3. String Constants
A string constant is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
```cpp
const char* greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

---

## 5. Array of Strings
An array of strings is an array where each element is a string.
```cpp
string colors[3] = {"Red", "Green", "Blue"};
```

### 5.1. Strings as Class Members
A string can be a member of a class.
```cpp
class Person {
  public:
    string name;
    Person(string n) {
        name = n;
    }
};
```

### 5.2. Standard C++ String Class
C++ provides the `string` class, which makes working with strings easier compared to character arrays.
```cpp
string str1 = "Hello";
string str2 = "World";
string result = str1 + " " + str2; // Concatenation
```
