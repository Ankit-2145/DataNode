### 3. **Concept of Files and Directories**

In DOS, files are stored in directories. Each directory can contain files or subdirectories, creating a tree-like structure for organization.

- **File**: A named collection of data.
- **Directory**: A special type of file that holds references to other files and directories.

    B --> D[File 1]
    C --> E[File 2]
    C --> F[Subfolder]
    F --> G[File 3]
```

### 4. **Wild Card Characters**

Wild card characters are used to represent multiple files or patterns in DOS commands.

- **\***: Represents any number of characters.
  - Example: `DIR *.TXT` lists all files with the `.TXT` extension.
- **?**: Represents any single character.
  - Example: `DIR ?.TXT` lists files like `A.TXT`, `B.TXT`, etc.

### 5. **Redirection Operators**

Redirection operators allow the input or output of a command to be redirected to files or other commands.

- **>**: Redirects output to a file.
  - Example: `DIR > LIST.TXT` saves the directory listing to `LIST.TXT`.
- **<**: Takes input from a file.
  - Example: `COPY < INPUT.TXT` takes input from `INPUT.TXT`.
- **>>**: Appends output to an existing file.
  - Example: `DIR >> LIST.TXT` appends the directory listing to `LIST.TXT`.
